description: Research Knowledge Acquisition Engine with 5 campaigns (literature-survey, patent-mining, benchmark-archaeology, meta-analysis, baseline-establishment). Use this skill whenever a user needs to systematically acquire research knowledge — academic literature, patent landscapes, benchmark evaluations, cross-study statistical synthesis, or SOTA performance baselines. Pre-condition: north-star-crystallization must be complete.

# Knowledge Acquisition

Systematic research knowledge acquisition engine. Five campaigns, each a self-contained autonomous research activity domain. You provide a research intent — the engine routes to the right campaign, selects a strategy, and executes autonomously with quantitative budget enforcement.

## Pre-condition

North-star-crystallization must be complete before entering any campaign. Research intent must be fully crystallized.

## Four-Level Hierarchy

```
ENTRY.md (this file)
  → Campaign (5): self-contained research activity domain
    → Strategy: selected by analysis purpose/intent
      → Tactic: multi-step orchestration pattern (reusable across strategies)
        → SOP: single operation (import or subagent)
```

## Campaign Routing

| Signal | Campaign |
|--------|----------|
| 文献调研、综述、论文搜索、PRISMA、snowball | → literature-survey |
| 专利分析、prior art、白空间、权利要求、IPC | → patent-mining |
| benchmark 分析、评估方法、metric 缺陷、排行榜、饱和度 | → benchmark-archaeology |
| 跨研究统计综合、效应量、异质性、发表偏倚、GRADE | → meta-analysis |
| SOTA 整理、性能对比、baseline 复现、进展曲线 | → baseline-establishment |

## Multi-Campaign Orchestration

Campaigns can be composed:
- **Serial**: literature-survey → baseline-establishment (survey first, then collect performance data)
- **Parallel**: patent-mining ∥ benchmark-archaeology (independent analyses on the same topic)
- **Conditional**: literature-survey → IF gaps found → meta-analysis (evidence synthesis on identified gaps)

The orchestrator decides composition based on the crystallized North Star statement.

## MCP Tools

| MCP Server | Tools |
|------------|-------|
| brave-search | brave_web_search, brave_news_search, brave_llm_context |
| apify | rag-web-browser, google-scholar-scraper |
| alphaxiv | discover_papers, get_paper_content, answer_pdf_queries, read_files_from_github_repository |
| semantic-scholar | ss_paper, ss_paper_batch, ss_references, ss_citations, ss_recommendations, ss_relevance_search, ss_author, ss_author_papers |

## Context Management Integration

- **Campaign start**: context-init (load/create campaign context file)
- **After each strategy completes**: context-checkpoint (append findings to campaign context file)
- **One context file per campaign**: all strategy outputs accumulate in a single campaign-scoped file
